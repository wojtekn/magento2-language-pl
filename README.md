# Magento 2 Polish language pack 

## Installing the language pack using Composer

To install language pack using Composer:

1. Open `composer.json` in text editor
2. Add the following line in `"require"` section:

   <pre>"rocketcode/magento2-language-pl_pl": "dev-master"</pre>

3. Save changes, close editor
4. Update packages using Composer:

   <pre>composer update</pre>

**Note**: I created this language pack mainly to test a Magento 2 translation
possibilities, not to maintain Polish translation for the Magento 2.
